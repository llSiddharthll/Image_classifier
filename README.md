# üåü ML-Django Image Classifier üåü

Welcome to ML-Django Image Classifier, a project that seamlessly integrates machine learning and the Django framework to classify images using the ResNet50 model by TensorFlow and Keras! This project provides a simple and user-friendly web interface, powered by Bootstrap 5, where users can upload images and receive the top 5 probabilities of classification for the given image. üñºÔ∏èüîç

## üìå Features

- **Image Classification**: ML-Django Image Classifier utilizes the powerful ResNet50 model to classify images into different categories, providing insightful probabilities for each classification.
- **User-Friendly UI**: The project offers a basic yet intuitive user interface, designed with Bootstrap 5, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload images through the UI, allowing them to classify images of their choice and explore the classification results.
- **Top 5 Probabilities**: For each uploaded image, the system displays the top 5 probabilities of classification, offering valuable insights into potential image categories.
- **TensorFlow and Keras Integration**: By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, this project achieves efficient and accurate image classification.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: The project's architecture allows for easy extension and modification, making it adaptable to different use cases and datasets.
